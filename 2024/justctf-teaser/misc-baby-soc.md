# Baby SoC

In this easy misc/forensics challenge, we are given only a `flashdump.bin` file and this description:

> We found really funny device. It was broken from the beginning, trust us! Can you help with recovering the truth?

## Analyzing the Flashdump

`binwalk`ing over the file doesn't yield any interesting results, but calling `strings` on it shows some ESP32-related symbols. We can assume that this is
a flashdump of an ESP32 microcontroller. Now, how to analyze what's going on here?

I found a nice [blog post](https://olof-astrand.medium.com/reverse-engineering-of-esp32-flash-dumps-with-ghidra-or-ida-pro-8c7c58871e68) on reversing ESP32 flash dumps, which recommends
a tool called [`esp32-image-parser`](https://github.com/tenable/esp32_image_parser). With some patches from the open PRs applied, we can dump the sections of the flashdump:

```shell-session
$ ./esp32_image_parser.py show_partitions ../flashdump.bin
reading partition table...
entry 0:
  label      : nvs
  offset     : 0x9000
  length     : 20480
  type       : 1 [DATA]
  sub type   : 2 [NVS]

entry 1:
  label      : otadata
  offset     : 0xe000
  length     : 8192
  type       : 1 [DATA]
  sub type   : 0 [OTA]

entry 2:
  label      : app0
  offset     : 0x10000
  length     : 1310720
  type       : 0 [APP]
  sub type   : 16 [ota_0]

entry 3:
  label      : app1
  offset     : 0x150000
  length     : 1310720
  type       : 0 [APP]
  sub type   : 17 [ota_1]

entry 4:
  label      : spiffs
  offset     : 0x290000
  length     : 1441792
  type       : 1 [DATA]
  sub type   : 130 [SPIFFS]

entry 5:
  label      : coredump
  offset     : 0x3f0000
  length     : 65536
  type       : 1 [DATA]
  sub type   : 3 [COREDUMP]

MD5sum:

Done
```

As per the blog post, we can now transform the application sections (only `app0` turned out to matter in our case) to ELF
files:

```shell-session
./esp32_image_parser.py create_elf ../flashdump.bin -partition app0 -output app0.elf
```

Now we have an ELF file that we can analyze with Ghidra.

## Analyzing the Application

Looking through the strings used in the file, we can quickly find that there's some HTML for displaying the flag. Therefore, this should be a web server
of sorts.

![Function writing the HTML](./misc-baby-soc-1.png?raw=true "Function writing the HTML")

Looking at where the stuff gets written to, we can quickly find the part that should write the flag:

![Function writing the HTML (Analyzed)](./misc-baby-soc-2.png?raw=true "Function writing the HTML (Analyzed)")

Analyzing where the values come from, we can find that the flag is computed by XORing two values from the data section into `something_in_flag`:

![Function computing the flag](./misc-baby-soc-3.png?raw=true "Function computing the flag")

Performing this XOR in Python gives us the flag:

> `justCTF{you_x0r_me_r1ght_r0und_b4by}`
